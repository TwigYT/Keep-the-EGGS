# Keep the EGGS
Dislike the new egg textures? This pack fixes that! 

This pack changes all the [new egg textures](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/test-new-egg-citing-features) to the [old ones](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Spawn_Egg#Icons).

# Context
When I first saw the new eggs, I thought that they look to complex; to unique; (and some) to ugly. I thought the game looked better with a simpler design. To be fair, Minecraft is a simple game. And with the new mob variants and the new eggs, Minecraft is getting too much detail. It like its losing its “Minecraftyness.” So I made this pack in one afternoon and evening, same day that the snapshot was released.

Thanks for downloading!
