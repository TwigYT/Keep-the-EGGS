# Context

When I first saw the new eggs, I thought that they look to complex; to unique; (and some) to ugly. I thought the game looked better with a simpler design. To be fair, Minecraft is a simple game. And with the new mob variants and the new eggs, Minecraft is getting too much detail. It like its losing its minecraft charm. So I made this pack in one afternoon and evening, same day that the snapshot was released.
