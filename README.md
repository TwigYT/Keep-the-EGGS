# Keep the EGGS
Dislike the new egg textures? This pack fixes that! 

This pack changes all the [new egg textures](https://github.com/TwigYT/Keep-the-EGGS/blob/eb98a657a28864cca633cbeb9e5094aad6b77ab0/images/image2.png) to the [old ones](https://github.com/TwigYT/Keep-the-EGGS/blob/eb98a657a28864cca633cbeb9e5094aad6b77ab0/images/image3.png).

# Context
When I first saw the new eggs, I thought that they look to complex; to unique; (and some) to ugly. I thought the game looked better with a simpler design. To be fair, Minecraft is a simple game. And with the new mob variants and the new eggs, Minecraft is getting too much detail. It like its losing its “Minecraftyness.” So I made this pack in one afternoon and evening, same day that the snapshot was released.

Thanks for downloading!
